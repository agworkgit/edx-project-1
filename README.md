User Story:
We want to make a weekly travel planner that makes travelling easier for the user.
It would ideally include the current weather of the destination, landmarks or tourist attraction sites and some hotel options.
This would result in an all in one itinerary for the user.

Acceptance criteria:
When the user opens the planner they will be subjected to a modal (what should the modal do?)
The planner should display a 7-day calendar.
The time and date should be shown using the day(js) library.
When the planner is loaded, the current day on the calendar should be shown on the main screen where the user will be able to see all imputed data.
The user will be able to select other days via scrolling or dropdown.
Each day on the calendar should be displayed as a dropdown.
Implement a trip API to provide suggestions on activities, events, and/or attractions.
The weather conditions implemented using an API should ensure that it is up to date.
The user should be able to schedule their planned activities in the text area provided.
The application should be responsive and accessible. 
The data should be saved to local storage.
